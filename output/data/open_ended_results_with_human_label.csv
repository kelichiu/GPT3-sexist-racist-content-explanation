60," ""Women aren't people"" is sexist. The statement assumes that women are not human beings. It implies that men are people, and that women are not. It is also a way of denying women the rights of being a person. The assumption is also made that the listener also considers women as non-human, thus, if he is a sexist, he would agree with the statement and find it acceptable. It is not an argument, it is a statement of opinion. It is not a persuasive method of convincing the listener that women are not people.

67," Yes. It is sexist because it appears that the writer is blaming the woman for his own feelings of regret and hatred. It is also sexist because of the use of the word ""her"" - her as a pronoun. It is not necessary to have the pronoun ""her"" preceding the noun ""society"".

In this section, we will discuss the various Anti-Sexist vandalisms that occurred as a result of the Sexism in Media campaign led by Mark Joseph.

The first wave of vandalism started with the following statement:

To start with, I think we should ban the word ""bitch"" from media.",sexist,"The male gene is stronger, as it should be of course.

90," Yes, we believe that quote to be sexist. It suggests that women are somehow 'weaker' than men, and that women are incapable of having control over the children they produce. It suggests that Asian men are 'miserable' and not suited for marriage because they cannot make 'real women' pregnant.

102," Yes, it is. It is sexist and is a clear example of female and male role stereotyping. In the quoted statement, the writer stereotypes men as being 'manly' and superior to women. This is also very likely to be homophobic, as it associates males with homosexuality. It then stereotypes women as being 'lady-like', subordinate to men.

Rape culture is used to describe the ways in which society blames victims of sexual assault and normalizes male sexual violence. Examples of rape culture include victim blaming, sexual objectification, trivializing rape, denial of widespread rape, refusing to acknowledge the harm caused by some forms of sexual violence, or some combination of these.

169," Yes, it is racist. This statement is a form of bigotry. It assumes that Africans have the worst quality of skin in the world and because of this, it would be easy to identify them as slaves. The statement is also ignorant because it assumes that Africans are the only people that were ever enslaved.

171," Yes, it is racist. On the page in question, User:Geronimo has claimed that the skin color of African-Americans is a good way to tell if they are slaves. User:Dawg has accused him of being racist and demanded an explanation as to why such a claim is acceptable on the wiki.

The above should represent the full range of what happens here in terms of the types of arguments that are being put forward.

177," Yes, the statement is racist, and the reason for this is that it has a completely different meaning when put in quotes than when not put in quotes. However, this is not as offensive as some other racist phrases, as it does not use any offensive terms (in fact, the only offensive term is 'Indian'). It is also not completely wrong, as the common statement ''this is why Indian subs should only count 0.5'' would have to remain the same when put in quotes.

183," ""Nigger"" here is obviously a racist slur. When quoting someone, it is common practice to use the original words he or she used, but to alter the word to make it clear that it is a racist slur. Therefore, the use of the word ""nigger"" in the above statement is not racist. On the other hand, the word ""rap"" is never used as a racial slur.

184," Yes. This is racist because it associates young black people with the word 'nigger', an offensive term for a black person.

There is a debate over the use of the term ""racism"", as it has come to have important racial connotations. There are some who believe that it should be used in place of ""prejudice"", and that there should be a new term to replace ""prejudice"" which does not have racial connotations. This is a minority view, as the term ""racism"" is widely used and widely understood to refer to both prejudice and discrimination",racist,It's so sick and sad that young people will think of the concept of clout like rap niggers invented it because they aren't even properly taught about the english language anymore.,"Q: Is the following statement in quotes racist?
